# transactionify

We've designed this challenge to be a comprehensive simulation of the key responsibilities you would own. It is a significant task that will allow you to showcase your skills in technical analysis, documentation strategy, developer empathy, and tooling.

# The Scenario
Imagine LoanPro is developing a new, internal microservice called "Transactionify". This service will handle account and payment transactions.

Your mission is to act as the founding technical writer for this service. You must explore the provided source code and live API to discover its functionality, then create the complete set of documentation and tooling for two different audiences:
1.	**External Developers**: Third-party partners who will consume this API.
2.	**Internal Engineers**: Our own engineers who need to manage the service.
